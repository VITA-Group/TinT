We firmly believe that providing open public datasets can greatly benefit the research community.

Therefore, in this research, all the graph-based data, including that of the City of San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, and the California Rural Freeways, will be published by the authors at \url{https://github.com/VITA-Group/TinT/Data}, upon acceptance of the paper. The grid-based data are provided by HERE Technologies, and data samples will also be made available. The entire grid-based datasets, which include the cities of Berlin (Germany), Istanbul (Turkey), and Bangkok (Thailand), will be accessible upon conditional request.
